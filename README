enable to modify glyphs in a BDF font with 'bdf2bmp'


SYNOPSIS
    bmp2bdf [numberOfColumns] input.bdf input.bmp output.bdf

    'numberOfColumns' can be omitted.  If omitted,
    numberOfColumns becomes 32.


DESCRIPTION
    Working with the bdf2bmp utility (not this tool),  the
    bmp2bdf utility (this tool) enables you to modify glyphs
    in a BDF font file.

    See EXAMPLES.


EXAMPLES
    1)  Prepare a BDF file.  Now,  'courR14.bdf' is
        prepared.

    2)  Use bdf2bmp to create BMP-image-file.
        $ bdf2bmp courR14.bdf courR14.bmp

    3)  Modify 'courR14.bmp' with some image editor ( like
        Adobe Photoshop, The GIMP,...) .
        For example,  add '0'(zero) with a slant line.
        Save that BMP file in the name 'cr14.bmp'.

    4)  Use bmp2bdf.
        $ bmp2bdf courR14.bdf cr14.bmp cr14.bdf
        You get 'cr14.bdf'.


LIMITATION
    o)  This tool accepts only the BMP files made with
        'bdf2bmp'.

    o)  This tool accepts only that BMP files:
        4/8/24 bits per pixel(16/256/16M colors),
        Windows-format,
        none compression.

    o)  This tool cannot modify DWIDTH,  that is,  the
        distance from this glyph origin to the next glyph
        origin.
        If you want to modify that,  you must modify the
        BDF file directly,  or should use other BDF
        editors.

    This tool internally distinguishes black(R,G,B = 0,0,0)
    from any other colors in the color palette.  This tool
    recognizes white-backgrounds, spacing, and gray colors
    to be equal.
